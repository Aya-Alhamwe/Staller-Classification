# 🌟 Stellar Classification Project
In this project, we classify stars based on their spectral and astronomical properties to determine whether they are *dwarfs* or *giants*. 🌌
We use a dataset that contains various features such as *absolute magnitude* and *color index*, which help us accurately predict the type of star. By leveraging these properties, we aim to build a model that provides reliable star classification and contributes to the understanding of stellar evolution. 🚀

## 🔍 Key Features:
- *Spectral analysis*: Classifying stars based on their spectral type (SpType) and other light-related properties.
- *Astronomical properties: Using key features like the star's **visual apparent magnitude* (Vmag), *distance from Earth* (Plx), and *absolute magnitude* (Amag) for accurate classification.
- *Machine learning model: Developing a model that utilizes these features to improve classification accuracy between **dwarfs (0)* and *giants (1)*.

## 📊 Dataset:
The dataset contains several key features necessary for the classification task, including:
- *Vmag*: Visual Apparent Magnitude of the Star.
- *Plx*: Distance Between the Star and the Earth (Parallax).
- *e_Plx*: Standard Error of Plx (remove rows with high e_Plx for better accuracy).
- *B-V*: Color index (hot stars have lower or negative B-V, while cool stars have higher values).
- *SpType*: Spectral Type of the star.
- *Amag*: Absolute Magnitude of the Star.
- *TargetClass: Whether the star is a **Dwarf (0)* or a *Giant (1)*.
